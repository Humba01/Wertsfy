# Configurations for the various build types
# ---------------------------------------------
# This is a collection of configurations for various build types.
#
# Each configuration is a dictionary that defines the build type and the
# settings for that build type.
#
# The build type is used to determine the target and the settings that are
# used for the build.
#
# The build type can be one of the following:
#
#   - debug: The debug build type.
#   - release: The release build type.
#   - profile: The profile build type.
#   - coverage: The coverage build type.
#   - test: The test build type.
#   - test-coverage: The test-coverage build type.
#   - test-debug: The test-debug build type.
#   - test-release: The test-release build type.
#   - test-profile: The test-profile build type.
#   - test-coverage-release: The test-coverage-release build type.
#   - test-coverage-profile: The test-coverage-profile build type.
#   - test-coverage-debug: The test-coverage-debug build type.
#   - test-coverage-release-debug: The test-coverage-release-debug build type.
#   - test-coverage-profile-debug: The test-coverage-profile-debug build type.
#   - test-coverage-release-profile: The test-coverage-release-profile build type.
#   - test-coverage-profile-profile: The test-coverage-profile-profile build type.
#   - test-coverage-release-profile-debug: The test-coverage-release-profile-debug build type.
#   - test-coverage-profile-profile-debug: The test-coverage-profile-profile-debug build type.
#
# The settings are defined as a dictionary that contains the following keys:
#
#   - build-type: The build type.
#   - target: The target to build.
#   - cmake-parameters: The parameters to pass to CMake.
#   - ctest-parameters: The parameters to pass to CTest.
#   - ctest-tests: The tests to run.
#   - ctest-timeout: The timeout for each test.
#   - ctest-output-on-failure: Whether to output the test output on failure.
#   - ctest-xml-file: The path to the XML file to output.
#   - ctest-xml-timeout: The timeout for the XML file.
#   - ctest-xml-compression: The compression level for the XML file.
#   - ctest-coverage-output-on-failure: Whether to output the coverage output on failure.
#   - ctest-coverage-xml-file: The path to the coverage XML file to output.
#   - ctest-coverage-xml-timeout: The timeout for the coverage XML file.
#   - ctest-coverage-xml-compression: The compression level for the coverage XML file.
#   - ctest-coverage-html-file: The path to the coverage HTML file to output.
#   - ctest-coverage-html-timeout: The timeout for the coverage HTML file.
#   - ctest-coverage-html-compression: The compression level for the coverage HTML file.
#   - ctest-coverage-xml-file-exclude-files: The files to exclude from the coverage XML file.
